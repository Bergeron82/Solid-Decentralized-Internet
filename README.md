# Solid-Decentralized-Internet
HTML/CSS I Final for WEB 110 JCCC Course

This was the first site I created as part of the Web Development Associates at JCCC. As the final for the course it required 5 pages, one page including a form element and one page detailing course objectives. The topic for the site was based on personal interest and research on Tim Berners-Lee's "Solid" project.
